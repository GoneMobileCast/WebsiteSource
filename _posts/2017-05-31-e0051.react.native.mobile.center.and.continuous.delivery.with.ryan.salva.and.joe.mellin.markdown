summary: Heard of React Native but not sure what the hype is all about? We've got you covered! At Microsoft's Build conference we sat down with Ryan Salva and Joe Mellin from the Mobile Center team to chat through React Native, how it works, and how it compares to other approaches such as Xamarin. We also dig into the full app development lifecycle, and how React Native and Mobile Center can help you continuously deliver quality apps to your users.
